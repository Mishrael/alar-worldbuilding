The Lorekeepers, a global organization in the world of Alar, embody the noble pursuit of reclaiming lost history and preserving knowledge for the betterment of all. Comprised of explorers, historians, researchers, scribes, and librarians, the Lorekeepers are driven by their unwavering commitment to uncovering the truths of the past and sharing them with the world.

As a completely independent and non-profit organization, the Lorekeepers operate without any ulterior motives or hidden agendas. They understand the inherent danger in forgetting the past and recognize that the key to avoiding a second subjugation lies in remembering and learning from history's lessons. Their mission is to ensure that the mistakes and triumphs of the past are not lost to time, but rather serve as a guiding light for the present and future generations.

The Lorekeepers undertake extensive explorations, meticulously study ancient texts and artifacts, and painstakingly compile historical records to piece together the fragmented history of Alar. They traverse dangerous territories, unravel mysteries, and delve into forbidden archives, all in pursuit of the knowledge that has been hidden or deliberately destroyed.

Unlike other organizations that might hoard or manipulate information for personal gain or power, the Lorekeepers operate on the principle of open access. They freely offer all the information they discover to the rest of the world, recognizing that the collective understanding of history benefits everyone. By sharing their findings, they hope to empower societies, foster understanding among different cultures, and ultimately prevent the repetition of past mistakes.

The Lorekeepers' humanitarian approach to knowledge preservation has earned them a respected reputation across the globe. They are respected as unbiased seekers of truth and guardians of historical integrity. Scholars and common folk alike turn to them for guidance, research, and insights into the mysteries of the world. Their libraries and archives, meticulously maintained and diligently expanded, serve as invaluable resources for those who seek to understand the past and shape a better future.
