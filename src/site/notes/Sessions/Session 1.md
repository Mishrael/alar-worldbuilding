# Recap
Cat meets frogified Cobb. Cobb meets Aerith. They take a voyage over to White Harbor in Valla, Aeirth meets new gods (who dis?). Aerith, Cobb, and Cat take passage on an Athanaue vessel named Tiedvenar, captained by Veyra Serran. After several weeks, close to about three days from Anbaerin, the Tiedvenar stumbles upon Duke, saving him from a gruesome death at sea. 

Duke says he's been shipwrecked, having been attacked by pirates. The captain buys the story, giving Duke clothes, and the 1st mate gives Duke his father's sword, a worse for wear cutlass, to help Duke on the streets of Anbaerin. 

A couple days later, the ship makes it's way into the harbor of Anbaerin, giving many the first sight of the city they ever had. The silver spires of the Halls of the Lords Anbaer rise out of the sea, bringing High Town's wall with it as the sea pulls away from the city, then the Great Wall of Anbaerin surfaces, gleaming white, revealing the enormous sea gate into the harbor. 

Tiedvenar is boarded by customs, and the passengers into Anbaerin are given papers to enter the city, register anomalous creatures, like familiars -- as Cobb is masquerading as one -- and to record the survivor account of Duke. Capt. Serran flips Aerith a special gold coin, and askes her to say high to Flo for her. When asked what she meant, Calithar gives them a riddle: You could use some Respite. Look for the Beggar.

Party goes through the Harbor Master to exist customs, and Duke then gives his account of the pirate attack and shipwreck, posing as Darton Adelby, a crewmember of the Silverfish, a Raffgrove Exports vessel. Broa Raffgrove will be notified that her ship was sunk and that there is a survivor. The interviewer, Olivia, asked if Duke would let them know where he was staying should there be any more survivors that surface. Also she offered that the Navy might be welcoming to an experienced sailor, and strongly suggested that he report to his employer Broa Raffgrove. He was then given leave to enter the city.

Once in the city, Duke bears all to his new friends, erring on honesty rather than keeping things secret, especially when he wasn't totally convinced that his story was bought. There are some initial reservations, and some high tensions, looked like there was a small pow-wow of fire kindling going on, but with the potential of redemption Aerith steers the party to accept Duke and help him out. Especially since Duke seemed to have knowledge of a black account here in the city somewhere. 

Being hungry, the party follows Aerith, who's the only one that's been here before, and find some Matanese fair that has a small upper room, that they took their food in. There they planned, establishing the goal of faking their way into getting the money and draining the account, or stealing it outright if things go sideways. 

Coming back down the steps the Matanese shop owner askes for the frog on Aerith's shoulder for 2sp -- likely to eat it. Which sparked a conversation to stage an insurance fraud scam. Step 1 insure the talking frog, Step 2 get the frog stolen, Step 3. profit?, Step 4, get the frog back, step 5 chill. 

Aerith, can't abide the conversation and goes looking for supplies, keeping an eye out for a beggar. Finding one, she meets Vedin, Two-fingers -- who, unironically, has two fingers on his right hand. Vedin then leads them all down to a well loved/worn door in an alley, where no other taverns or restaurants could be found, does something with the coin and the door that he hides from the party, and opens the door. He ushers the group in, and starts calling for Flo!
