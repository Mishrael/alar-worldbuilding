To pick up where we had left off, dear reader, we had left our party in conversation to the venerable Professor Arawn Valadin, imbibing tea and partaking of crumpets, as they awaited the arrival of Professor Thornwood, Professor Syble Thornwood. And as our astute readers may remember, we had promised to describe Ms. Thornwood in detail when next your eyes met our humble script, and we shall do so, for it is at this moment that Professor Thornwood barges, into the room, sliding to a stop, just within the threshold, blue eyes gleaming with determination, her cascade of brown curls, falling near as far as the hem of her skirts, which, of a solid verdant green, with ribbons sewn into the fabric to replicate flowers, fell to her ankles, somewhat frazzled beneath her prodigious pointed hat, that was so tall the point buckled under its own weight, and the brim so wide it nearly took up the doorway. She herself, though full of interest now, had smudges about her face -- a clear sign of absent-mindedness that many a genius acquire as they day-dream and theorize and create new worlds in their minds, and had a youthful appearance, for she was but six and twenty years of age, framed by a heart-shaped face -- generally a sign of coquettishness, though certainly not in the case of Syble Thornwood, for we have, on good authority, was rather awkward in social interactions, which she will demonstrate for us this very moment. 

Professor Thornwood enters our scene and demands of Professor Valadin what was so interesting. Professor Valadin gestures to the frog on Aerith's shoulders, that is to say he gestures to Cobb, and almost instantly Professor Thornwood deflates, or rather on the inside she does, outwardly, however, she becomes more calm and collected. 

It is precisely at this moment, however, that a surprise actor falls into our history -- quite literally! There is the sound of creaking brass, as a window -- among the many atop the bookshelves of Professor Valadin's study that provide the study with such magnificent light, opens, and a person tumbles through, knocking off various paraphernalia and several books as this newcomer topples to the floor. Professor Valadin and Thornwood, and, to be sure, our famous friends, Aerith, Cat, and Cobb, turn to eye this intruder of sorts. However, the reception is not hot, as Professor Valadin is a rather collected individual, and Professor Thornwood is not the least protective over things that are not hers. So the intruder is welcomed with relative warmth, for having just trespassed, but not the heat that ends in violence. Valadin, does a cursory identification on this new woman, for woman she was, and with curious nod, allows the new arrival to stay, asking the party if she belonged with them. 

We wish not to interject overmuch into this narrative, especially as many things are happening at once here, but it is precisely these moments that require careful detail and necessitate those bound to the unraveling of history to peel back the layers of detail carefully, with discernment, and lay them out as concisely as we are able. Thus, we must be allowed two words about this mysterious individual. She was of average height and an athletic build, with fair hair the spilled from pale, golden cloth, eyes of gold, and wearing distinctive golden jewelry around her wrist, at her neck, and at her crown, each with modest but beautifully crafted gemstones -- amethyst we are sure. She was immediately frantic, but to the credit of the professors involved and our party's nerves, the calm nature of this not-intruder's surroundings did much to soothe nerves from panic to a relative ease, if we might be so bold as to assert. 

All this while, Professor Thornwood discovers that Cobb is a frog! And while this is not news to you, our fine readers, and may not be news except for the most perspicacious of us, it was news to Professor Thornwood. Allow us to frame Professor Thornwood's thoughts in just this way: upon arriving Thornwood was told that the frog was what she would find interesting, and at first -- to her -- it was simply a frog. Now, however, she has learned that the frog has a name, though that is not so uncommon, as many people name their pets, but then, come to find, that this frog was not only named, but named not by the one whose pet it was, and then compound all of this with that Cobb was a frog that could speak, and was not awakened, but was a human man before becoming a frog! Thus, Professor Thornwood discovers that Cobb is a frog, and just as quickly, Thornwood is transfixed on Cobb, and wishes to study him. For the time being, she has no more to say than what Professor Valadin has already communicated to the party, confirming his theories. No, words would do little for Syble Thornwood in this moment, for she is a woman of action -- that action being experimentation. She, so desirous to learn the how's and why's of Cobb the frog, picked Cobb up and began to walk away with him. 

It is here, then, that our newly acquired friend, show her mettle. Brixta, for this is what she would call herself, upon seeing that Cobb was being absconded with for unknown purposes -- unknown to the party at least, we are certain that Professor Thornwood knew quite clearly what she intended to do, and without his own consent, declared that she put down the frog, whom Brixta reminded Thornwood was a person. To which, Professor Valadin agreed, seeing that this might indeed turn uglier than was necessary, if things did not proceed carefully. 

Professor Thornwood, for her part, acknowledged the rudeness, which is to say that she released Cobb, and encouraged Cobb to return on the morrow to be examined, for she verily wished to know more of Cobb's condition, as Professor Thornwood, which Professor Valadin had already communicated to the party, was the premier expert on Transmutation magics and the theory of the self and its immutability. How could such a scholar of the Arcane Arts not be so enraptured by something that flies in the face of one's own theories and worldview. 

There was little enough conversation to be had after that, but with a few good ribs at Cobb's expense and some slight explorations into Brixta's presence, the party was ushered out, that Professor Valadin might make his next class, though, not before the good professor first extended the offer to Brixta to return tomorrow morning for the entrance examination. 

Brixta it would appear, though continuing with the party, seemed at once distant and enthusiastic all at once. From what can be gathered, Brixta was shy of the religious, for good reason we assume, though we must cast our hopes on our readers' kindness and mercy that we, alas, cannot relay such reasons at this time, but that these mysterious and provocative reasons might, indeed, reveal themselves, should the reader continue along with our history. Nonetheless, Brixta accompanies the party, being taken in by their kindness, well Cat's and Aerith's, truly -- though we must admit that Cobb did show a special camaraderie with Brixta from once she fell into their company. 

With that ephemeral, yet triumphant sensation of accomplishment, swirling in their chests, these principle actors of ours make way to meet with one Radden Steinabrook, whom we are assured, our readers remember from but hours earlier in the day. Their path of some 6 mi made swift by the public transportation that boggles the minds of many a newcomer to this marvel of marvels, depositing them at the street of the dyers where they made their way up to the Market of the Morning by way of lower canal street, where they found the headquarters for the Sixth Precinct, and where they had made plans to meet with Corporal Steinabrook to engage in that time-honored tradition of violence against friends!

And upon gaining entry, for the guards have little to fear within their own compound, they were found then by Corporal Steinabrook, and taken over to a wooden corral, one made for testing fighters, not for the domestication of animals, and with a gathering crowd Radden throws himself into the ring and promptly invites our friend Cat in with him.
