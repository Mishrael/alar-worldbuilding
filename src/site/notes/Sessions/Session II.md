The party starts off in the Beggar's Respite, seeking Flo by the hoarse cries of Veden, Two-Fingers. Duke sets off to try contacting his contact for the black account, and the party set up at the bar to get some more grub, since it'd been about an hours worth of travel, and to hone their plans for what they're doing in the city. 

Flo approaches them, after they seat themselves, and takes note that they want food and walks away to the kitchen without taking orders. Cobb and Aerith get into conversation spanning the morals of insurance fraud, the dangers of owing money to the Sahiradim, aka the Enchanter's Guild, other schemes to get rich quick -- eventually (such as marrying some elvish heir/heiress), and finally spiraling into a long debate over whether Septur is/was worth worshipping. 

Meanwhile, Cat gets bored, and steps outside. As he emerges from the alleyway, a stranger asks if he's looking for a good time, he enthusiastically says yes, and is given a trac that tells him he'll find a good time at the Cloistered Purse, on Beller's and Caul. Unfamiliar with Anbaerin, and probably streets in general, Cat decides to stop another stranger to ask for directions. The man he stops is short and rotund -- one might say pudgy -- and he's flanked by two goons. The short man, in snappy evening attire, takes a look at the note, takes a glance at Cat, and crumples the trac and tosses it away, claiming he wouldn't have fun there and that Cat should instead come with him, they're all best friends now after all. 

Cat is led to one of the city's original buildings, and instantly there's a feeling of wealth in the lobby. The short man is respectfully greeted by staff, and he hands Cat over to his two goons to show him where the fun is. Cat is led down to the basement of the building and told to stay in a room lined with weapons and a cot and dresser, and at the far end is a portcullis. Cat is enthusiastic about his 'fun'.

Cobb and Aerith eventually come to realize that Cat is missing, and determine to go after them. There's a brief exchange with if they'd be able to find the Beggar's Respite again if they left, but without any clear answers they leave. Aerith is sloshed. Leaving the Beggar's Respite, upon the door closing, the coin given them by Capt. Serran falls to the ground, ensuring that they'd likely be able to find the door again if need be. Opening the door without the coin opens to a solid wall. 

Cobb and Aerith, are given the same trac by the same stranger Cat encountered, but are fortunately steered in the right direction by an observant beggar with a stutter. And enter the establishment. Upon entering, they are immediately recognized as out of place, and a staff member comes over to ask them to leave, only to be interrupted by a sophisticated, fair-haired, elvish gentleman. He vouches for his 'country cousin' and her 'familiar' and askes them his rooms -- after saying he would usually not recommend doing so with a stranger. 

Once in the room, the gentleman, calling himself McGoughin, helps "McCobby", Cobb, and "McLovin'", Aerith, understand the position they're in. Their friend Cat has become the sacrificial entertainment for the night. McGoughin, reveals himself to be morally gray, clearly participating in an illegal death battle, and clearly bored with the event already. 

Together Cobb and Aerith hatch a plan to get them down to the lower levels, so that they can save Cat from quite possibly certain death, and McGoughin gets to have a more interesting night. As recompence, since McGoughin seems fairly reasonable, he says he'll give the party a flat rate reward plus a percentage of the winnings. 50g + 1%. 

Cat left to the mercies of the gauntlet in front of him, battles a goblin, two wolves, and a bear, before Cobb and Aerith show up and help him in a fight with two giant spiders, and lastly a giant scorpion. With this tremendous upset, and victory for the party, the session is drawn to a close.
