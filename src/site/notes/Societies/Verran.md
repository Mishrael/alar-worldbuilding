Also known as Grey Elves, Verrans are an isolationist, matriarchal society. What is known about Verrans is that they worship the Goddess of Moon, Ishtariel, whom they worship as their creator. Verra, the land they call home, exists in a perpetual cloud cover that rivals a kind of eternal twilight. Many consider this land cursed as a result, but the Verrans revere the land and call it blessed by Isha, the moon more commonly known as Ilum. They recognize Sef, which they call Syf, but only in so far as it being Isha's consort. 

Verrans do not speak of their homeland to outsiders, or rarely do, but it is clear that their society is founded on strong druidic principles.
