# Vallan Subcultures

> [!important]- Valladune
>    - /vɑ.lɑ.ˈdu.nej/
>     
> Hailing from the earliest lineages of elves, and perhaps the first elves themselves, the Valladune have seemingly persisted across the ages. However time has not been kind to the Valladune, as over the years they've either died away or diluted the blood across the newer bloodlines of Vallans, however, the death stroke for the Valladune was the Maladreth, commonly known as the Darkening, when they were all but wiped out. Now only a handful of Valladune survive, and many of them holding on by the barest thread of sanity.  Three of the Valladune sit on the Silmaedhrin (Silmaer: Holy one; -dhrin: an assembly, organized gathering), commonly the Synod, guiding the Aelitharan (aelith: to light the way, to guide; -ar: nominal suffix; -an: plural case). The few remaining others are spouses to those on the Silmaedhrin or are scattered across the world. It is estimated that there are fewer than 20 Vallandune across all Alar.

> [!Important]- Eladrene
> - /ɛl.æ.ˈdrej.ne/
>     
>  Elves that retreated to the Feywilde and came back.
> 
> The Eladrene were a group of elves that returned from the Feywilde. Though, since entering and exiting the Fey plane is an imprecise process -- at best -- many Eladrene came back during the Lorath'duin to then be affected by the Maladreth. No one is sure how long the Eladrene were gone, many think of them as dubious and untrustworthy. The kind to escape to a realm of whimsy and fanciful legends with hidden dangers, rather than suffer alongside the rest in  the Arduin, the Subjugation. There is a brief hope that an Eladrene will appear on the material plane with their memories intact, at least their memories before entering the Feywilde. Though because time gets so convoluted in the Feywilde, it's hard to know when an Eladrene possessing such critical information might arise, with the passage of two hundred years since the Maladreth, hope is waning that such a hero will come to alleviate their woes.
> 
>  As alluded to, the Eladrene are elves that have spent a remarkable amount of time in the Feywilde, some say thousands of years, which defies logic, and some say they were gone for only a handful of years, which also defies logic. Regardless of how long the Eladrene were gone, all of them have been affected by the Maladreth, which convolutes their stories even further. Because of the time spent in the Feywilde, however, they have also changed. Their eyes are often luminous and pupilless, or very bright in color at the very least. Their appearances also tend to change with their moods, reflecting different seasons of the year. It's no wonder the elves returning from the Feywilde have changed so considerably, as elves tend to take on the aspect of the nature around them.
> 
> Eladrene tend to be playful, irreverent, devilishly cunning, with a strong capricious streak. They tend to make great performers. Many Eladrene, especially the subsequent Alaran born generations, have mellowed out considerably over the past two hundred years.

> [!important]- Sovarene 
> - /sov.ˈɑ.rej.ne/
>     
>  The Sovarene, close descendants of the Valladune, have long occupied the harsh climes of the hinterlands and the Vallan range of the Western Spine of the World. They are a hard people, that know their business and mean to handle it. Because they live at typically higher elevations than their lowlander cousins, Sovarene are typically smaller, but have slightly larger thoracic cavities, proportionally, to accommodate proportionally larger lungs than other Vallans.
> 
> Sovarene survive off of their herds mostly, leaning into the work of the Provider Sylvaril, and are culturally, quite similar to the Vassari. Though they forego belief in a personal Hunt, and are not tribal.
> 
> Sovarene are generally terse and to the point. They have the benefit of the perspective of living for hundreds of years, but the pragmatism to nip an annoyance or a threat in the bud, and aren't afraid to do so. Famously cheap, too.

> [!important]- Teial
>  - /ˈteji:.ɑɫ/
>     
>  Living in the eastern moores, they've come to become known for the land they occupy, secretive and untrustworthy. Or perhaps the land became secretive and untrustworthy as a result of its inhabitants. It's hard to know which with elves.
> 
> The Teial have lived among the mashes and moores in the East of Valla for who knows how long. Current estimation puts them as having been the exiled and outcast among the Vallans, sent to work and live in the moores some thousand years ago. Since then they have built up the moores and made it their own. As such, many consider the moores to be a lawless land, a place where scum and villainy thrive. Or at least that used to be the case. Now the moores have been incorporated into the Vallan state as the Talatlani Moores, guided by Aelithar Talatlan. The reasoning behind the moores becoming more than just a place of exile is due to their unification under the Talatlans guidance, and, subsequently, the commercial viability of the moores beyond a simply important natural habitat. Bog iron, and peat being a primary export, among various rare plants and local delicacies.
> 
> The rougher elements of the moores, though perceptibly and significantly lessened, still exists for those who know where to look. And though publicly frowned upon, the Teial secretly enjoy their duplicity. The moores, now flush with cash, and a plethora of legitimate business ventures, is still the number one place to order an assassination, get any number of deadly and difficult to deal with poisons, and any number of other illicit products and services.
> 
> Teial are viewed with trepidation, as swarthy, untrustworthy, and greedy. But they are tolerated, at least some of them are. And though other Vallan impressions of the Teial might be too judgmental, the Teial do exude ambition. They seem to have very few qualms about how they see their ambitions come to fruition either.

> [!important]- Athanaue 
> - /ath.ˈɑ.nɑu.ej/
>     
> Sailors and great shipwrights. The sea calls them forth from Valla.
> 
> The Athanaue, commonly known as Sea Elves, and this group transcends nationalities, are a group of elves that feel more comfortable at sea than on land. They would contend that Verra, Valla, nor Vassarin are their home, but that the winds call them to the waves and that is their home. The majority of Athanaue, do happen to be Verran, but no small part of the Athanaue is made up of Vallan and Vassari.
> 
> The best shipwrights around found in Valla, though, where it's said the shipwrights are able to shape the wood without tools.
> 
> Athanaue are a generally warm and welcoming bunch, but they are rather secretive about their trade and society. When asked about their ships, or what they do out on the sea, or how they manage to stay at sea for such long periods of time, they tend to masterfully change the subject through joke or jibe, or steer the conversation away from such topics. When pressed, they vary in their approaches, from saying that these things only concern the Athanaue to threats of harm for the most persistent of investigators.
> 
> Thus, there is much mystery surrounding the Athanaue, with many mistrusting them for their secrecy and equating them to pirates. But for those that use their services to traverse the oceans deep, they are the most experienced, and dependable sailors money can buy, and often times they're more interested in trades of goods or services than cold, hard gold.

> [!important]- Mierdune
> - /mi.ˈɛr.du.ne/
>     
> Perhaps the most numerous, population of Vallans.
> 
> Unlike the other societies, aside from possibly the Teial, the Mierdune are not exactly a bloodline. For the past hundred years or so there have been many elves of the new generation who have been congregating together, affecting change, and wandering abroad. Mierdune are more a society built on like-ideals rather than place of origin or bloodline. They represent a group of young elves that are unsatisfied with the traditional passive observer, slow to act role the Vallans have played in recent history. This attitude has led to more Vallans than ever leaving their homeland, to wander and to seek answers.
> 
> Mierdune are often viewed as hasty, even by Vassari standards, known among Vallans as hot-headed.
