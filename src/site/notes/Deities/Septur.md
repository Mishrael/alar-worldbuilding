# Goddess of Light
Septur is one of the first of the gods to be freed, and was the patron god of the Dawncaller, Aemarick Frethon, and is one of the primary deities in the established UKL pantheon. As her moniker signifies, she is the goddess of light, and seeks to push back the darkness and illumine the path. However, and perhaps ironically, she is not known to be a warm or necessarily gentle deity. Her adherents call her austere and sometimes cold, but that she provides truth in a world of chaos, and that is well worth giving her their worship and attentions. 

### Tenets of Faith
###### Let Truth be Your Light
*Truth can both protect and destroy, but better that Truth destroy than to let lies fester.*

###### Be a Guiding Light
*Bring light to the darkness. Uncover what is hidden. Seek the truth of all things no matter the cost.*

###### Gentleness and Mercy
*Though the shadows do not deserve mercy, creation is pure and must be allowed to turn from the Shadow. Do not use the Truth as a bludgeon, it is a two-edged sword, and it will cut when it needs to.*

###### Guard Against the Shadow Within
*Even in the brightest soul, darkness can grow unseen. Be vigilant of doubt, fear, and secrecy in yourself and others, for shadows fester where light does not reach.*

###### The Light in All
*All of creation was made for Light, and Light will come to all in the end. Be bold and share your Light.*
