# Ishtariel & Sylvaril, God of Unity


### Tenets of Faith
1. **Celebration of Union and Family Bonds**: As a dual god, they might be worshiped through family-centric ceremonies that honor marriage, childbirth, and relationships. Rituals could involve dances, communal feasts, and celebrations under the moonlight to symbolize the unity of two different forces working in harmony.

2. **Guidance and Protection of Communities**: Followers of the united Ishtariel & Sylvaril might take oaths to protect their communities, serving as mediators or peacekeepers within families or between clans. Their worship could involve practices that encourage wisdom, guidance, and fair conflict resolution, seeing unity and mutual respect as divine principles.

3. **Strength Through Duality**: Their worship could emphasize acceptance of differences, using Ishtariel’s nurturing qualities with Sylvaril’s strength to handle conflict, be it within relationships or in matters of war. Warriors, for example, may seek strength through balance, blending compassion and resolve in battle or defense.

4. **Creation and the Reverence of Mortal Life**: Worshipers may celebrate life in all its forms, acknowledging the divine origin of mortal kind. They might hold seasonal festivals to honor the creation and fostering of life, symbolizing each season with aspects of either Ishtariel or Sylvaril, and reinforcing the balance needed to sustain all life.

5. **Pilgrimages and Dual Shrines**: Temples dedicated to both gods could feature dual shrines where worshipers honor both individually yet acknowledge their unity, symbolizing the strength of their bond in duality. Pilgrims might walk between these shrines, physically embodying the journey between the distinct yet connected forces that sustain the world.

In either form, these gods encourage followers to embrace the full range of existence—from wildness to beauty, from strength to gentleness, and from solitude to union—always with an underlying respect for balance and unity amidst diversity.
