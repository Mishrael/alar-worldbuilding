### **The Wandering Wand** _(Magic Shop & Enchanted Trinkets)_

- **Owner:** **[[Characters/NPCs/Shop Owners/Lillan\|Lillan]] Evermere** _(Human, NG)_ – A warm and knowledgeable shopkeeper with a passion for practical magic and a talent for making even the most nervous apprentice feel at ease.
- **Familiar:** **Arlo**, a **box tortoise** shell that shimmers faintly under candlelight. Despite his slow movements, he has an uncanny ability to "wander" when no one is looking, often found in unexpected places around the shop.

#### **Description:**

Nestled within the **Third Tier of Anbaerin**, _The Wandering Wand_ is a **cozy and welcoming** magic shop, filled with shelves of carefully labeled reagents, softly glowing potions, spell scrolls, and enchanted curiosities. The shop has a **quaint, well-worn charm**, with a ceiling hung arcane lights that give off a soft glow and a counter covered in half-scribed spell scrolls. Despite its humble size, the shop is **surprisingly well-stocked**, offering both common magical goods and the occasional rare find at **fair prices**.

Lillan is known for her **honest dealings**, and many **young wizards and spellcasters** make their first real magical purchases here, earning her a reputation as a **trusted mentor-figure** within the arcane community. She has connections to several arcane institutions within Anbaerin, occasionally taking commissions to **recharge wands** or **restore faded enchantments**.

#### **Shop Atmosphere & Unique Features:**

- **Soft, hanging lights** illuminate the shop without casting harsh shadows.
- A **chalkboard menu** near the entrance lists current stock and newly available items.
- Arlo, the **wandering box tortoise**, moves **mysteriously** throughout the shop, often found resting atop rare books or inside display cases he shouldn’t be able to reach.
- A **side room** serves as a **small consultation area**, where Lillan discusses her commissions based options.
