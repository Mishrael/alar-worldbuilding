**Race:** Half-Elf  
**Class:** Wizard (Divination) 

**Overview:**  
Brixta’s **student mentor**, Merys Telwynn, is **a second-year student specializing in Divination**, hand-selected to **help guide her through the beginnings** of her studies. Unlike some of the more **eccentric or ambitious students**, Merys is **steady, methodical, and deeply observant**—a sharp contrast to Brixta’s own natural instincts.

**Appearance:**

- **Tall for a half-elf, lean, and graceful**—always composed, never rushed.
- **Long dark brown hair**, usually **tied back neatly**, but never **overly formal**.
- Wears **modest scholar’s robes**, the **sleeves embroidered with intricate celestial runes** of **Divination**.
- His **gray-green eyes have an unsettling way of seeing through people**—a common trait of Diviners.
