**Race:** Tiefling  
**Class:** Wizard (Abjuration & Divination)  
**Alignment:** Neutral Good

**Overview:**  
Nia Voss is a **second-year student** specializing in **Abjuration and protective magic**, making her a **perfect match** for Lirian, who lacks confidence in his own abilities. Unlike **Evren’s strict mentorship**, Nia takes a **gentler, encouraging approach**, believing that **a great mage is not just skilled, but emotionally strong.**

She has **an academic mind**, but is also **deeply empathetic**, always willing to **listen and guide rather than dictate.** She understands that Lirian **doubts himself**, and instead of pushing him aggressively, she **helps him see his own potential.**
