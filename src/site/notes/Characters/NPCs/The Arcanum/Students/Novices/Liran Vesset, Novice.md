### **Liran "Liri" Vesset – The Reluctant Prodigy**

**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Wizard (Abjuration) 

**Background & Personality:**  
Liran never actually _wanted_ to attend _The Arcanum_. The son of a **overbearing father**, he spent most of his youth **pressured into studying magic**. Though **brilliant** with defensive magic and counterspells, he has no **burning desire for arcane mastery**—he just **doesn’t know what else to do with his life.**

Despite his talent, Liri is **soft-spoken, introverted, and reluctant to stand out**. He dislikes confrontation and **hates being the center of attention**.
