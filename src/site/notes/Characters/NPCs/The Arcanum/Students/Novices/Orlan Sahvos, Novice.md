**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Wizard (Evocation)  
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral

**Background & Personality:**  
Orlan is **not reckless—but he is ambitious.** The son of a **spellwright**, he grew up in the workshops of magical artisans, where precision and responsibility were drilled into him from a young age.

Orlan is **highly disciplined**, but also **a perfectionist**—a student who passed the exam not just for his skill, but for his **intellectual rigor and ethical approach to power.** He sees magic as something to be **crafted, refined, and improved** rather than wielded carelessly.

He is **driven to be the best**, but not out of arrogance—**he believes that a mage must constantly strive to refine their craft,** and he views magic as **both an art and a responsibility.**
