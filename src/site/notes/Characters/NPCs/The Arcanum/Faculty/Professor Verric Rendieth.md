**Title:** **Master of Novices**  
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Wizard (Universalist, Arcane Scholar)  

#### **Overview:**  
Professor Verric Rendieth is **the first true authority figure new students encounter** after their acceptance. His role is to **shape raw potential into disciplined understanding**, ensuring that students **internalize The Arcanum’s philosophy and ethics** before they dive deeper into magic.

A **former field scholar**, he spent much of his life researching the **philosophy of magic, the ethics of spellcraft**. He is **highly structured, methodical, and unyielding** in his standards, **yet not cruel**—he believes magic is **a privilege, not a right,** and that those who wield it must be **held to higher moral and intellectual standards.**


####  **Role at The Arcanum**

- Oversees **all new students for their first 3 months**, ensuring they:  
    - Understand **The Arcanum’s core principles** (_knowledge, discipline, wisdom_).  
    - Learn the **fundamentals of arcane philosophy and ethics**.  
    - Are assessed for **their magical potential & responsibility**.
- Acts as **both teacher and judge**, determining whether students **are ready for full integration** or **require additional training**.
- Keeps **detailed records** of **every student’s strengths, weaknesses, and psychological profile**, sharing **recommendations with faculty mentors**.
- If a student **fails to meet The Arcanum’s standards**, it is **he who delivers their dismissal.**

#### **Personality & Teaching Style**

- **Patient, but unwavering.** He does not tolerate **laziness, recklessness, or ambition without discipline.**  
- **Sharp-witted and perceptive**—seems to **always know what a student is thinking before they speak**.  
- **Firm believer in responsibility**
- **Tests students through questions, not spells.** He cares more about **how they think** than **what they can do.** 

#### **Notable Philosophy (What He Teaches First-Years)**

- _"The greatest failures in magic were not caused by lack of power. They were caused by lack of understanding."_
- _"If you do not know the limits of a spell, you do not know the spell."_
- _"Mastery is not the ability to cast magic. It is the wisdom to know when not to."_

#### ** His Relationship with Students**

- **Highly respected, even by those who dislike him.**
- Students often **fear his judgment**—he is the first major **authority figure** they must impress.
- Some consider him **unnecessarily harsh**, but others understand that his **unrelenting expectations exist for a reason**.
