**Title:** **Master of Novices**  
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Wizard (Universalist, Arcane Scholar)  

**Overview:**  
Professor Verric Rendieth is **the first true authority figure new students encounter** after their acceptance. His role is to **shape raw potential into disciplined understanding**, ensuring that students **internalize The Arcanum’s philosophy and ethics** before they dive deeper into magic.

A **former field scholar**, he spent much of his life researching the **philosophy of magic, the ethics of spellcraft**.

**Appearance:**

- **A tall, wiry man in his late 50s**—with **sharp, piercing hazel eyes** that seem to see right through people.
- Wears **deep blue academic robes**, **pristinely kept**, with **gold-stitched runes of ancient magical laws** woven into the hems.
- **Close-cropped silver hair** and a **beard kept short and neat**—not a single strand out of place.
- His **movements are precise, efficient**, as if he wastes neither motion nor words.

✔ **Sharp-witted and perceptive**—seems to **always know what a student is thinking before they speak**.  
✔ **Firm believer in responsibility**—often reminds students:  
_"Magic is not power. Magic is knowledge made manifest. The two are not the same."_

### **💀 Notable Philosophy (What He Teaches First-Years)**

- _"The greatest failures in magic were not caused by lack of power. They were caused by lack of understanding."_
- _"If you do not know the limits of a spell, you do not know the spell."_
- _"Mastery is not the ability to cast magic. It is the wisdom to know when not to."_
