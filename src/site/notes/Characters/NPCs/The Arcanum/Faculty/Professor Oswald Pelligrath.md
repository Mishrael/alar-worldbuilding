### **Professor Oswald Pelligrath**

**Title:** Professor of Arcane Engineering & Master of the Runic Forge  
**Race:** Gnome  

**Overview:**  
A **genius in magical innovation**, Oswin Pelligrath is responsible for many of _The Arcanum’s_ arcane inventions, from **self-correcting spellbooks** to **sentient floating lanterns**. He is a pioneer in **Runic Engineering**, blending spellcraft with mechanics to create new forms of magical technology. He runs the **Runic Forge**, where students build and refine arcane constructs.

**Teaching Style:**

- **Excitable and fast-talking**, prone to overwhelming students with information.
- Encourages **wild creativity**—no idea is too outlandish.
- Believes **failure is part of learning**, often saying, “If it didn’t explode, you’re not thinking big enough!”

**Personal Quirks:**

- His **beard is full of small, self-animated gadgets**—tiny clocks, moving gears, even a miniature automaton that takes attendance.
- Wears **spectacles with six interchangeable lenses**, flipping between them constantly.
- Occasionally gets _so lost in thought_ that he forgets he’s **talking out loud** to himself.
