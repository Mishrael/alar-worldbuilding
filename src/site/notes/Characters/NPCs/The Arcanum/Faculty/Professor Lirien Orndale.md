### **Professor Lirien Orndale**

**Title:** Professor of Divination & Principal Augur  
**Race:** Half-Elf

**Overview:**  
Lirien Orndale specializes in divination magic, fate manipulation, and the hidden flow of destiny. What can and can't be are sides to the same coin, and are often obvious once the decision is made, but what if the coin had many sides, what if paths were known before hand? Much of what Professor Orndale instructs have to do with such what-if's and how to detangle them. 

**Teaching Style:**

- Encourages _caution and precision_ in spellcasting.
- **Conversational and patient**â€”believes in mentoring over strict instruction.
- Loves _philosophical discussions_ on the nature of time, fate, and free will.

**Personal Quirks:**

- Occasionally answers questions _before they are asked_, unnerving students.
