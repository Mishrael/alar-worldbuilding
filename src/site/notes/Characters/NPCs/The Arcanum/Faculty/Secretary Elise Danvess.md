**Title:** Secretary of The Arcanum & Keeper of the Unbound Tome  
**Race:** Human

**Overview:**  
Not a professor in the traditional sense, nor, truly, a necromancer, Elise Danvess is a scholar of **death, entropy, and the boundaries between life and undeath**, though her primary duties involve keeping the school in running order, leaving the Seeker free to conduct investigations into Ilyndra's disappearance. She maintains the **Unbound Tome**, a vast collection of texts detailing how magic interacts with mortality. While some students fear her, she is **deeply ethical**, ensuring necromantic studies remain **a theoretical pursuit, not a corruptive practice**. 

**Teaching Style:**

- **Meticulous, methodical, and highly academic.**
- Expects students to **justify every spell they cast**—especially those involving life force.
- Takes a **philosophical approach**—“Is death a state, or merely a transition?”

**Personal Quirks:**

- Her shadow **sometimes moves on its own**, but she dismisses questions about it.
- Has **never been seen eating or drinking**, yet seems completely healthy.
- Keeps a **homunculus** named _Loren_, which takes notes for her.
