### **Professor Myrian Soldeva**

**Title:** Professor of Theoretical Thaumaturgy & Keeper of the Grand Orrery  
**Race:** Human 

**Overview:**  
Professor Soldeva is a scholar of **the fundamental forces of magic**—why magic exists, how it interacts with reality, and whether its limits are **truly immutable**. She oversees the **Grand Orrery**, a massive model of Alar and its celestial bodies that moves in accordance with arcane forces. She is **one of the Academy’s most enigmatic figures**, and some suspect she knows more about the **First Spell** than she admits.

**Teaching Style:**

- **Abstract and enigmatic**—asks students questions _they aren’t yet ready to answer_.
- Emphasizes **philosophy over spellcasting**—"Understand magic first. Wield it second."
- Has **no tolerance for arrogance**—believes wisdom, not power, defines a true mage.

**Personal Quirks:**

- Her lectures sometimes **predict future magical discoveries**, leaving students puzzled until they eventually come true.
- The **Grand Orrery sometimes moves in ways that don’t match known celestial patterns.**
- Has **no recorded birth date**, and older faculty swear she looks _exactly the same_ as she did fifty years ago.
