### **Professor Garrik Lódczyk**

**Title:** Professor of Elemental Convergence & Master of Conjuration  
**Race:** Dwarf  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Good

**Overview:**  
A grizzled but enthusiastic expert in **elemental magic**, Garrik Lódczyk is one of the leading scholars on how different elemental forces interact. He oversees the **Frost Vault**, a secured chamber where unstable elemental spells are tested. Despite his **Dwarven heritage**, he has little interest in traditional stonework and instead revels in understanding **fire, ice, air, and earth’s raw potential**. 

Professor Lódczyk works closely with the Explorer's League and the Lorekeepers in their exploration of Rükmar. 

**Teaching Style:**

- **Hands-on, experimental**—students learn best by doing (_and occasionally, by nearly setting themselves on fire_).
- Values **instinctive spellcasting** over rigid formulas.
- Encourages students to **blend elements in new ways**—some of the Academy’s strangest spells originated in his class.
