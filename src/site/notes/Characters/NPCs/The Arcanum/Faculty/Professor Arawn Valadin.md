**Title:** Professor of Illusion & Alchemy  
**Race:** Human 

#### **Overview:**

Professor Arawn Valadin is an **expert in illusion magic and arcane chemistry**, a combination that has led to groundbreaking work on how **the mortal mind perceives magic**. He is one of the **foremost scholars on illusion theory**, surpassing even the famed **Archmage Senmai** in terms of practical applications and theoretical depth. His work delves into **how sensory perception, cognition, and magical forces intertwine**, making his teachings essential for those who wish to master illusion at its most profound level.

Arawn is a **collected and contemplative** individual, rarely displaying strong emotions but possessing a quiet, **sharp wit**.
