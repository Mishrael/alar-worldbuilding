### **Professor of Evocation & Arcanic Defense**
**Title:** Professor of Evocation & Arcanic Defense
**Race:** Elf (Wood Elf)  

**Overview:**  
Aldros Duanelac is a towering presence at _The Arcanum_, both figuratively and literally. He is a master of **evocation magic**, particularly its applications in warfare, energy manipulation, and large-scale spellcraft. He once served as an _Arcane Tactician_ for the city’s defenses before returning to academia. 

**Teaching Style:**

- **Highly disciplined**—believes that raw power is meaningless without control.
- **Unforgiving, but fair**—will not tolerate reckless spellcasting but rewards ingenuity.
- **Focuses on arcane combat**—teaches students how to balance offense, defense, and efficiency in spell use.

**Personal Quirks:**

- Keeps his robes _impeccably clean_.
- Has a habit of muttering complex formulae under his breath when thinking.
- Wields a **custom spellstaff** that absorbs unstable magic and redirects it.
