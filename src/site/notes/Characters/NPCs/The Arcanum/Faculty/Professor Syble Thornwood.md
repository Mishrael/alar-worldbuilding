**Title:** Professor of Transmutation & Theoretical Selfhood  
**Race:** Human  

#### **Overview:**

Professor Syble Thornwood is _The Arcanum’s_ leading expert on **transmutation magic and the nature of the self**. Unlike most transmuters who focus on changing the external world, **Thornwood’s research questions the very boundaries of personal identity**—what it means to be oneself when the body can change. This has led her to develop **cutting-edge theories** on the **immutability of self**, as well as practical advancements in bodily transformation, object transmutation, and arcane reconstruction.

She is frequently lost in thought, and often **forgets basic social conventions** when she is excited about a discovery. Her **absentminded nature** does not come from a lack of awareness but from a brain that **operates five steps ahead of everyone else**. She is **brilliant but scatterbrained**, sometimes forgetting that ethical considerations **exist**, leading to moments of unintended insensitivity—such as picking up a _sentient, transformed person_ without permission.

#### **Teaching Style:**

- **Energetic and spontaneous**—often forgets she’s in a classroom when a new idea hits her.
- Loves **hands-on experimentation**, sometimes at _questionable_ personal risk.
- Often **loses track of time** and **forgets students’ names**, but remembers every _single_ detail of their magical progress.
- _“Magic is change. And if you think you understand change, you’re already wrong.”_

#### **Personal Quirks:**

- **Perpetually disheveled**—smudges of ink, soot, or transmuted materials are always present on her hands or face.
- Wears an **absurdly large pointed hat**, which is always in **some state of collapse** under its own weight.
- **Talks to herself constantly**—not as an odd habit, but because she’s _actually_ working through equations in real-time.
- **Does not believe in personal space**—tends to grab objects (or people) to examine them mid-conversation.

#### **Notable Achievements:**

- **Developed the leading theory on the "Arcane Identity Principle,"** positing that even when transmuted, a person retains a unique magical signature.
- Created the **"Thornwood Loop,"** an experimental transmutation field that **locks an object in a cycle of constant change**—though it is currently _too dangerous to use_.
