# Cat, Leonin Monk
When the event that lead to the discovery of magic occurred, many of the species found less desirable faded into obscurity. Some built small communities deep in the forests, one of which was a monastery where a Leonin cub lived. This cub studied with his elders about inner peace and how to defend oneself, which he would use the teachings to play. 


One day he was playing and wondered away from the monastery. He continued to play, even when it got dark. He didn't even notice he was away from home. No one was stopping him from playing, so he thought he could just keep playing. He had a copy of the elder's teachings that he would read from when he was tired of playing. He would hunt small game when he was hungry and seemed to luck into clean water sources.


The cub's playing continued for 30 years. (I leave this part up to the DM if someone finds him, or he wanders to a road at the edge of the forest and just decides to follow it.)
