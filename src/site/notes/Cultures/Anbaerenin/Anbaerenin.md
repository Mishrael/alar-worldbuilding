# Anbaerin, The Birthplace of Magic
Anbaerin is an ancient marvel. A city so large that it takes nearly the entire day to cross on foot, without the crowds, and not accounting for the other six tiers, but is also so magical that trains of stone carts can take you to most sections of the city within a fraction of the time! A city with impervious and immaculate white walls and nestled in the pass of a small coastal mountain range. A city with the largest harbor in Alar, to accommodate the vast volumes of trade that supports this monolith of metropolitanism. And, of course, the birthplace of The Arcane and home to the oldest school for The Arcane, The Arcanum. One could spend lifetimes in Anbaerin and barely leave their neighborhood. 

# 1st Tier, The Halls of the Lords of Anbaer
Many never set foot in the Palace, as the 1st tier is usually known, but many can see it's silvery towers and spires, like a crown on the city itself. The palace grounds span 1mi in diameter in the very center of the city and is Anbaerin's highest point, and is hemmed in by the 2nd Tier; separated by one of Anbaerin's three circular white walls. 

# 2nd Tier, High Town
High Town sits on the Palace slopes, surrounding the palace in a concentric circle. High Town is about 6mi is diameter, minus 1mi diameter for the Palace. The 2nd tier is within the 3rd tier, separated by one the second of Anbaerin's high walls. The four Grand Lifts also start, or end, in Tier Two. 

High Town is also the beginning of Governor __ jurisdiction, and is home to both the Anbaerin Hall of Concord, where the Council of Nobles and Council of Commons meet with The Lord, and his Governors to deliberate over matters of state and bring suggestions to his Lordship. This Hall of Concord, however, does not fall under anyone's jurisdiction but it's own. 

High Town is also home to The Arcanum, the Ist Library of the Lorekeepers, Anbaerin's Skyport, and much of Anbaerin's nobility. There are a couple of tiers one might think to go for training in magic, the 2nd and 4th tiers, and subsequently these are the places to go if you would like to purchase magical services. If you want magical goods, however, the 3rd tier is more often your best bet. 

If you want to a taste of the high life, Hight Town is where you're aiming.

# 3rd Tier, The Bazaar
The Bazaar, or trade town, or just about any variation on trade or money or shopping could potentially get you pointed towards this tier. The Bazaar surrounds the Second tier, and fills out those final 8mi of city to 1st wall of the city. Anbaerin is a never sleeping city, something is always happening within its walls, but if ever there were a city that never slept within the city that never slept, it would be the Bazaar. Trade courses through this part of the city like no other, and it stops for no man, woman, storm, night, or god -- though, ironically enough the temple district is found here. 

The Bazaar has just about anything you could think to buy or sell. Food, materials, exotic craftsmanship, magical trinkets, jewels, and services of a startling variety. Day or night you'll likely find what you're looking for here. 

The Bazaar is also the point of entry for just about everyone, unless you came via airship, it is home to The Explorer's League, and the largest harbor in the known world, but probably the whole world. Though the 3rd Tier itself doesn't get access to the Grand Lift, people must either travel to the 2nd tier or down to the 4th tier to access them, there is the Caravan Road that corkscrews from the 3rd tier all the way down to the 9th tier.

# 4th Tier, Tinker Town
The 4th Tier, lovingly called Tinker Town, is the industrial sector of the city -- or, at the very least, is the largest industrial sector of the city. Vocational guilds dominate the political landscape of Tinker Town, largely because there are so many craftsmen that call this tier their home. If something needs making, Tinker Town is generally where it's made. It's also the first full tier in Anbaerin travelers will encounter, running the full 15mi diameter of the city. As such, Governor __ employs a generous smattering of Aldermen to assist in governance of the 4th Tier.

Despite the predominantly industrial nature of this tier, Tinker Town is also home to a vibrant social scene, from nobility to commoners, ranging from classy galas to two-bit snail races. Tinker Town is also home to several magic academies -- all of which claim to be better and greater than The Arcanum, but are generally unknown beyond the 4th Tier, itself; not to mention they'll cost you an arm and a leg to attend.

The Tinker Town is also the 3rd most populous tier behind Mid Town and The Warrens.

# 5th Tier, Mid Town
Mid Town most commonly sited as the most populous tier, but census data from Tier 7 is not always trustworthy. Tier 5 is also called the Green Tier, due to its abundance of parks, which Governor __ has carefully cultivated through both municipal and community resources. 

The other tiers might lay claims to a various acclaim worthy institutions or people, but Tier 5 has fostered a reputation of relative peace and tranquility. I do say relative, since it is still Anbaerin, and everything here works at a faster pace, but the large recreational and residential zones don't leave room for the same scale of hustle and bustle as is found in many other tiers. 

# 6th Tier, Drift Ward
Drift Ward is in a strange in-between. Anbaerin, as a city so large, has a flourishing crime community, and Drift Ward kind of straddles the line between dingy underbelly and upstanding suburbia. But perhaps that is unfair. On the surface, Tier 6 looks a lot like Mid Town, except without all the green. Sure there are parks and recreational spaces, just as any other Tier -- even Tier 4, but there's a subculture that is hidden underneath the surface. Drift Ward got it's name, because it's become known that if you want to dabble in illicit goods without getting your hands too dirty, it's the place to go, but it's also the spot for people from the lower tiers to come and be part of "polite society" if they can find their way out of the warrens. 

Drift Ward is also about as far as any upstanding, self-respecting merchant will go for trade. As the reputation for Tiers 7, 8, and 9 speak of more lawlessness and poverty than much of anything else. 

# 7th Tier, The Warrens
The Warrens, as Tier 7 is colloquially called, is the first Tier of what many call the underbelly of Anbaerin. It does still have a Governor, and there is a guard presence in The Warrens, but that hasn't prevented the Tier from decaying ever so gradually over the years. Some blame the distance from the surface and lack of real air and weather and sunshine, but the other tiers seem to do well without. Still, others blame the proximity to The Bowels. Whichever it is, The Warrens has received it's name due to the ramshackle building expansions that spring up, creating a labyrinthine quality to it's streets, combined with a substantial population, even for an area as massive as one of Anbaerin's tiers. 

Governor __ has taken great lengths to attempt to clean up The Warrens and spruce up it's reputation, but the denizens of the 7th Tier seem to casually disregard the Governor's many edicts, and not all guards are infallible, which is to say that bribery and corruption run rampant among the authoritative bodies in The Warrens. 

# 8th Tier, Low Town
Low Town, for several generations now, has been the lowest Tier many citizens could legally travel to, as the 9th Tier had been sealed off years ago due to depopulation. But with recent events in the 9th Tier, it has been opened back up for population. However, the 8th Tier has retained its moniker as Low Town, and is still what many an Anbaerenin thinks of when they think of a hive of scum and villainy. Tier 8 has a Governor, but Governor __ tends to spend his time in Concord and in High Town than in the 8th Tier itself. Which, perhaps is wise, since he's received numerous death threats. The 8th tier is also largely unpoliced. 

# 9th Tier, The Bowels
Colloquially known as The Bowels, the 9th tier -- historically used be called Low Town, but since it's disuse up until recently, the title for Low Town has gone to the 8th Tier, now, instead, known as the city's Bowels. The Lord of Anbaerin reopened the 9th Tier and has started revitalization efforts, a thing not attempted in over a century, due to an incursion of elves from The Deep. One might think to seal it up tighter, but it's disuse has been argued to be the reason that such a malignant force was able to gather. As such, the task has been appointed to the new Governor of the 9th Tier, Ainsley J. Winters, previously a well respected Councilor in the Commons, and the only nearly singularly resposible for the salvation of the people in the lower tiers during the invasion efforts of the deep elves. Though, there was a considerable effort and help from a few traveling heroes. 

With the Revitalization underway, and the 9th Tier slowly waking back up, Lord Anbaer intends the 9th to be a safeguard against the encroaching Deep. And perhaps a way to help eradicate the criminal elements of the 7th and 8th tiers, or at best a way to keep better tabs on the goings-on there.
