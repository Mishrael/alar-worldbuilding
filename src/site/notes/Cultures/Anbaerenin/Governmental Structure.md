There are three bodies of government: The Lord of Anbaerin, The Governors, and Concord.

The Lord of Anbaerin

The Lord is the top of the pecking order. He sets the tone of Anbaerin to the greater world, and for his people. He has the power to dismiss, and to set laws. The other governing bodies are not strictly necessary since the Lord can do as he pleases, just about. However, the rule of fear lasts only so long as your subordinates haven't grown tired of being afraid. Thus wisdom dictates that the great Lord bend his ear to the lowly peasant, and while this isn't strictly the case in Anbaerin, Lord Caeric I did establish a system of governors to better rule over his people, and to hear from them. This established a trend in Anbaerenin policy that leaders should listen to their people. To this end, Governors were given Aldermen, Concord was established, first for the nobility, then for the common man, yet the Lord of the City retained his authority. The whole body of government outside the throne was instantiated as a sounding board, for both the Lord of Anbaerin and its people.

The Governors

Taking wisdom from the cobbled together remains of an ancient political treatise, Vor Saenum, of establishing your leaders of your thousands, and leaders of your hundreds, and leaders of your tens, Governors are one of the lowest resolution leaders in the governmental body of Anbaerin. Because each tier of the city is so large, Anbaerin's Lord felt it necessary to appoint people over each tier. This means that Governors oversee the daily municipal operations of the city for close to 1 million people each. Which, even though divided, is a monumental task, and it is why Governors are allowed to hold elections for Aldermen. With enough Aldermen, the Governor need only concern him/herself with tier-wide matters. Still, Aldermen are optional, and some Governors seem to have little use for them.

Governors hold some sway over the Lord of the City, As they offer a higher resolution report than what the Lord Anbaer might be able to gather himself. While they are left to deal with their respective tiers as they see fit, they are also bound by whatever decisions the Lord might make, and their position as Governor is only secure so long as they don't fall out of line or out of favor.

Aldermen

Aldermen occupy a leadership role at the highest resolution, meaning they are the closest to the ground and the goings-on in the city. This is possible only because they run districts, rather than oversee city functions for hundreds of thousands of people. These districts can still be quite large, however, and some Governors only appoint Aldermen over troublesome districts that need more oversight. Thus not all districts are allowed an alderman, but when the Governor wishes to have an Alderman preside over a particular district, they are elected by popular vote, by eligible voters from the same district. These Aldermen are usually esteemed or popular individuals from the district itself, they must prove they live in the district to be eligible for office by law, and are entrusted to carry the desires and will of the people up the chain of command, though the Alderman's buck stops at their Governor, usually. Among other things, and depending on the district, the Alderman oversees various municipal operations, including infrastructure, commerce, and public relations. They also oversee any kind of festivities. Aldermen receive budgets from their Governors, and Governors receive their budgets from the Lord.

Concord

- Chamber of Lords

Long ago the aristocracy of Anbaerin wanted more of a voice in policy making, and, so, through much toil and debate, Concord was structured. Representatives from every family of significant wealth and influence were selected and chosen to represent the interests of their families. This has since changed, somewhat, now that there are thousands of members of Anbaerin's aristocracy, it would be much too burdensome for each family to send even one delegate each. So there are a total of 240 representatives, 30 nobles from each tier, voted into office by a vast majority of eligible votes.

- Chamber of Commons

A much newer body of governance, established after the Dawnbreak Campaign as many commoners fought and died and became heroes of the war to end Subjugation and felt they had paid for a voice with much blood and sacrifice. The current Lord of the City, could not deny them, and established the Chamber of Commons as part of the Concordia. They were given an equal number of seats, so as to say their voices mattered as much as those of the fellow Concordia in the Chamber of Lords, and were voted in by eligible votes from the common populace of Anbaerin, where the Chamber of Lords are voted in by the nobility. This was a landmark decision by the Lord Anbaer, but not even the nobility of the city could refute the commoners their place in the Concordia, nor did many wish to.
