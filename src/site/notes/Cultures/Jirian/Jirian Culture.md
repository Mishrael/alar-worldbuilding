# Jirians

Denizens of Ank'Jir and it's provinces, Jirians are bound together more by their cultural love for trade than by national borders, but, of course, borders definitely don't hurt. Jirians have a reputation abroad as swindlers and cheapskates, but to the average Jirian, foreigners simply don't know how to strike a deal. Driven by ambition and trade, whether a passion for it or for greed or ego, the Jirians came together as a nation, under 7 Khazimiri, almost as soon as the Demons were cast back into the Abyss. 

The singular reason Ank'Jir became such a trading powerhouse with the known world, especially being a considerable distance across the sea from Lar, Ione, and Valla, were their airships. No one knows how or where the Jirians obtained the knowledge to craft such amazing vehicles, and many of the nations of the world are secretly attempting to replicate Jirian efforts. Though, for over two hundred years, Ank'Jir has been able to remain the only nation with such technology. Which leads many to believe that the Jirians have been sabotaging efforts to research flying vehicles. 

But due to this advantage, Ank'Jir became a force to be reckoned within the world of trade. Their ability to travel by air is what secured them the region of Sah, within what is now the United Kingdoms of Lar, which allows them to transport goods across the ocean, skipping Anbaerin most times, and their tariffs, and depositing goods in a relatively central location in Lar, wherefrom the bordering nations are far more lax than Anbaerin, or, even better, others come to them to trade and pay their tariffs.

Because of air travel, Jirians also have the best maps, which they can charge for a premium, if they you can trust any map they let foreigners have, whether or not it was paid for. Which brings up the topic of Jirian elitism. Jirians have an interesting view of the world, and that there is a particular balance. It's a sense of fate outside your control. So by their having air travel, and distinct advantage over any other means of travel, they have a sort of superior view of themselves, which they intend to keep.
